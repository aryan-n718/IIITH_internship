This project trains a YOLOv8s‑cls image classifier on the AIR‑125 baby sleep pose dataset to categorize infant sleep posture into three classes: prone, side, and supine. The model is trained in Google Colab using images exported from Roboflow with standard preprocessing (auto‑orient, resize to 224×224) and light augmentations (horizontal flip, small rotations, low noise) applied only to the training set.​

The final model reaches 100% top‑1 accuracy on the AIR‑125 validation and test splits (936 train / 89 val / 45 test images), with a perfectly diagonal confusion matrix. However, when evaluated on external baby videos with different cameras, backgrounds, and overlays, the model often misclassifies supine frames as side, indicating poor out‑of‑distribution generalization and strong reliance on background context rather than pure pose cues.​​

The repo includes Colab‑style training and inference code, plots of training curves and confusion matrix, and simple scripts to sample video frames and run frame‑wise pose prediction. Planned future work includes cropping around the baby (detection + classification), adding a background/no‑baby class, and expanding the dataset with more diverse recordings to improve robustness beyond AIR‑125.
