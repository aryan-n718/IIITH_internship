This project uses YOLOv8s‑cls for image classification on the AIR‑125 baby sleep pose dataset, with three classes: prone, side, and supine. Images are exported from Roboflow with auto‑orient, resize to 224×224, and light data augmentation (horizontal flip, small rotations, low noise) applied to the training set.​

On a split of 936 train / 89 val / 45 test images, the model achieves  top‑1 accuracy on both validation and test sets, along with a perfectly diagonal confusion matrix, showing clean separation between the three poses. The codebase includes Colab notebooks for training, validation, visualization (loss/accuracy curves and confusion matrix), and simple scripts to sample video frames and run pose predictions on baby sleep videos.​
